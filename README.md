This is a Django+SQLite app where I added multiple input fields to be added for each object in the database, and I added the update and delete actions from CRUD. This app allows you to make messages with your name that are stored in a database then displayed on screen. You can create, edit and delete these messages thanks to my additions.

This is just the backend using Django.
